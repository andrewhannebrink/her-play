    <!-- ABOUT THE BOOK SECTION -->
    <div data-content="about-book-heading">About the Book</div>
    <div data-content="about-book-intro">How did I go from the gritty casino floors of Warsaw to the sun-soaked luxury of Sir Richard Branson's private retreat?</div>
    <div data-content="about-book-p1">People love asking for a formula for success, as if there's some neatly packaged blueprint—ten steps, a morning routine, a life hack that guarantees a one-way ticket to the top.</div>
    <div data-content="about-book-p2">For years, I dismissed the question. I wasn't following a formula. I was following momentum—switching industries, taking jobs I wasn't qualified for (yet), moving countries on instinct, launching a startup with a newborn in one arm and a pitch deck in the other.</div>
    <div data-content="about-book-p3">At the time, there was no master plan—just a deep-seated instinct for knowing when to jump. But looking back, I see it now. A pattern. A rhythm. A way of turning risk into opportunity and change into a competitive edge. Maybe I did have a formula after all. And maybe this book is my way of defining it.</div>
    <div data-content="about-book-p4">But beyond the strategies, the leaps, and the bold moves, there's something else—something that rarely gets talked about in the success playbooks. The invisible forces shaping how we take risks, how we chase ambition, and how we respond to failure. It's not just about market trends or business models—it's about something deeper. The psychology of transformation. The way identity, mindset, and intuition shape our ability to adapt, evolve, and move forward when the next step isn't clear.</div>
    <div data-content="about-book-p5">Drawing from my own experiences in traditionally male-dominated spaces—where both strategic execution and intuitive adaptability were essential—I explore the evolving constructs of masculinity and femininity. I examine their societal origins, shifting relevance, and how they shape leadership, ambition, and self-definition. True power, I argue, comes from fluidly integrating structure and flexibility, action and instinct, drive and alignment—without sacrificing authenticity.</div>
    <div data-content="about-book-p6">This isn't just a collection of stories. It's a map of a mindset—one that turns setbacks into fuel, bold decisions into momentum, and challenges into stepping stones. It's about what separates those who take risks from those who stay put—not just courage, but clarity. Not just ambition, but action. The ability to own your story before someone else writes it for you.</div>
    <div data-content="about-book-quote">As Richard Branson put it, "You don't learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over." Until you don't.</div>
    <div data-content="about-book-p7">So, join me. We won't just map out the how—we'll uncover the why. The instinct that keeps us moving when comfort tells us to slow down. The drive to evolve when the world shifts around us. The mindset that makes us leap, even when the ground ahead isn't visible.</div>
    <div data-content="about-book-p8">At best, I'll give you the formula everyone wants. At the very least, we'll have one hell of a story to tell.</div>
